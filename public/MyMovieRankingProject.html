<h1> Siraj's List of Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My personal favorites</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Beautiful Mind</h3>
<p> This movie is special because it handles pieces fascets of human experience both the beautiful and tradgic. And how
    a relationship can flourish like a pheonix rising from its ashes and become stronger under the pressure of
    circumstance. A story of a man that has was handed a gift and a curse at the same time,and his ability with will and
    support to adapt and bring out the best in himself.</p>
<h3>I Want to Eat Your Pancreas</h3>
<p>One of the first Animes I've watched and a beautiful story of a young lady with cancer that has a unique relationship
    with an introverted young man. One thing that makes this movie special is the subtlety and innocence. It brings a
    beautiful dynamic between two contrasting personalities and shows just how much impact one person can make on your
    life. </p>
